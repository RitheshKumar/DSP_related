you were always using thresholding. Just that you lost track.

With filter: f-measure=86.67%
             precision=86.60%, recall=86.75%


Sans Filter: f-measure=81.03%
             precision=69.60%, recall=97.16%
             

more mistakes, you took multiple true positives for a given groundtruth.
here are new ones:

eval 9 = threshold of 3*mean(onset)/4 for the spectrul flux
             f-measure=55.15%
             precision=44.42%, recall=72.70%
eval 10= same as above, inclusive of adaptive thresholding
             f-measure=71.92%
             precision=74.81%, recall=69.25%
eval 11= test result of the onset detector from MIR toolbox 
             f-measure=70.63%
             precision=82.02%, recall=62.02%
eval 12= same as above, inclusive of adaptive thresholding with window of 0.05
             f-measure=71.71%
             precision=75.76%, recall=68.20%
eval 13= same as above, just spectral flux, but with the window of 0.05
             f-measure=72.88%
             precision=44.33%, recall=72.88%
eval 14= using the MIR toolbox, and with the window of 0.05
             f-measure=69.06%
             precision=82.30%, recall=59.4%
